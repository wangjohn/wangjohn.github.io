# Introduction

As part of my goal to finish [52 computer science problems in 52 weeks][52probs], I'm going to start on the second problem.

This problem is more of an algorithms interview question that is concerned with navigating around trees.

# Setup

Denote a tree `T` as a graph where any two vertices are connected by exactly one simple path. Suppose that each vertex `v` in the tree has a pointer to its parent and also to each of its children. Note that this tree does not necessarily need to be a binary tree, or a search tree. 

An ancestor of two nodes `v~1~` and `v~2~` is a node `a` such that `a` can be reached from both `v~1~` and `v~2~` by recursively following parent pointers. The lowest common ancestor of `v~1~` and `v~2~` is the ancestor `a` such the distance `d(a, v~1~) + d(a, v~2~)` is minimized, where the distance is defined as the number of edges traversed to get between two vertices.

# Problem 2

The problem is now as follows: you are given two vertices `v~1~` and `v~2~` which you know reside in a tree `T` which has an infinite number of nodes in it. Find the lowest common ancestor of `v~1~` and `v~2~`.
