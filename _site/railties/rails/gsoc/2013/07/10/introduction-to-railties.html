  <h2>Introduction to Railties</h2>
  <p class="meta">10 Jul 2013</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>As part of my <a href='http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013'>Google Summer of Code</a> project I&#8217;ll be refactoring Railties, the internal engine of Ruby on Rails. When a Rails application launches, there is a complicated process of configuration and initialization that sets the Rails web server.</p>

<p>Before you can actually set up this web server, there are quite a few things that need to be configured. Railties are the engines for reading these configurations, creating an application, and connecting different parts of Rails.</p>

<h3 id='the_railtie_class'>The Railtie Class</h3>

<p>All major components of Rails are created as a subclass of <code>Rails::Railtie</code>. For example, Active Record (which handles query syntax to a database) and Action Controller (which handles the base controller logic) are both Railties.</p>

<h4 id='so_what_does__do'>So what does <code>Rails::Railtie</code> do?</h4>

<p>Well, to figure out the function of <code>Railtie</code>, we can go look at the source code. Finding the definition isn&#8217;t too tricky. You can clone the Ruby on Rails source code from <a href='https://github.com/rails/rails'>github</a>. My primary method for finding class definitions is by using ack-grep, a convenient command line tool for searching through files. I searched for the following:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>ack-grep <span class='s2'>&quot;class Railtie&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This gives us the file which <a href='https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/railtie.rb'>&#8220;railties/lib/rails/railtie.rb&#8221;</a> which defines <code>Railtie</code>. A casual perusal of the file tells us a couple of things:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Railtie</code> is abstract. This means that it is not intended for direct instantiation. This is pretty clear because there is an error which is thrown inside of the <code>initialize</code> method whenever the class attempting to be initialized is abstract.</li>

<li><code>Railtie</code> serves mostly as an API that should be subclassed. This observation comes directly from the observation that <code>Railtie</code> is abstract. Abstract classes usually define methods which should be overwritten in subclasses. The documentation also gives us a good clue, because it provides examples where one subclasses <code>Rails::Railtie</code> and configures that subclass.</li>

<li><code>Railtie</code> has four main methods. These are <code>rake_tasks</code>, <code>console</code>, <code>runner</code>, and <code>generators</code>. For each of these methods, a block is added to a list of previously defined blocks. Here we can see <code>Railtie</code>&#8217;s true functionality: providing a way to configure anything which subclasses <code>Rails::Railtie</code>.</li>

<li><code>Railtie</code> is class based. Notice that the <code>new</code> method is private. What this means is that <code>Railtie</code> cannot be instantiated unless a subclass makes the <code>new</code> method public. This is one of the most interesting design decisions made by the Rails developers. In particular, it means that each subclass of <code>Railtie</code> operates without any instances.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id='class_based_design'>Class Based Design</h4>

<p>The last item I mentioned was the class based design of <code>Railtie</code>. To get a better sense of what this means, let&#8217;s look at an example of how one would create a <code>Railtie</code>. Since the <code>new</code> method is private, you can&#8217;t do the following:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='ss'>Rails</span><span class='p'>:</span><span class='ss'>:Railtie</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>new</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This would throw a runtime error saying that <code>new</code> is private. What is done instead to define a <code>Railtie</code> is this:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='k'>class</span> <span class='nc'>MyNewRailtie</span> <span class='o'>&lt;</span> <span class='ss'>Rails</span><span class='p'>:</span><span class='ss'>:Railtie</span>
  <span class='n'>initializer</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;new_initialization_behavior&quot;</span> <span class='k'>do</span>
    <span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;Hello!&quot;</span>
  <span class='k'>end</span>
<span class='k'>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Something subtle is happening here. The <code>new_initialization_behavior</code> initializer is being defined on the class instead of on any particular instance of <code>MyNewRailtie</code>. Normally this would mean that all instances would have access to this initializer, but since you can&#8217;t instantiate <code>MyNewRailtie</code>, we don&#8217;t really worry about that.</p>

<p>Instead, a singleton instance is created behind the scenes whenever you want to change the configuration of <code>MyNewRailtie</code>. Let&#8217;s examine the following code:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='k'>class</span> <span class='nc'>AnotherNewRailtie</span> <span class='o'>&lt;</span> <span class='ss'>Rails</span><span class='p'>:</span><span class='ss'>:Railtie</span>
  <span class='n'>config</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>before_configuration</span> <span class='k'>do</span>
    <span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;This runs before the initializers run&quot;</span>
  <span class='k'>end</span>
<span class='k'>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We&#8217;re changing the configuration of <code>AnotherNewRailtie</code>, but we&#8217;re doing this by accessing the singleton of the <code>AnotherNewRailtie</code> class. In the code, this is called the <code>instance</code>. It&#8217;s defined as follows:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='k'>def</span> <span class='nf'>instance</span>
  <span class='vi'>@instance</span> <span class='o'>||=</span> <span class='kp'>new</span>
<span class='k'>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Thus, this method grabs either the cached object in <code>@instance</code> or creates a new <code>AnotherNewRailtie</code> object and sets <code>@instance</code> to this new object.</p>

<p>All config methods inside of the class are sent to the instance, which will then configure the class. When you call <code>AnotherNewRailtie.config</code>, you will obtain the configuration from the singleton <code>instance</code>, with the <code>before_configuration</code> hook that we defined above.</p>

<h3 id='discussion'>Discussion</h3>

<p>Although the class based design of <code>Railtie</code> gives you a simple syntax for configuring subclasses of <code>Railtie</code> and referencing a particular subclass (just get it&#8217;s constant), it does run into some problems.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is that you can&#8217;t easily create multiple <code>Rails::Application</code> instances. The <code>Rails::Application</code> class defines all of the backend logic for a Rails application, but you can&#8217;t make multiple applications unless you create multiple subclasses (which isn&#8217;t easy to do programatically) or unless you make the <code>new</code> method public (which destroys the API nature of <code>Railtie</code>).</p>

<p>My <a href='http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/wangjohn/1'>GSOC project</a> will be attempting to fix some of these things, so stay tuned!</p>
