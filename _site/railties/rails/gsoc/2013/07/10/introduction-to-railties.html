      <h2>Introduction to Railties</h2>
<p class="meta">10 Jul 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>As part of my <a href='http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013'>Google Summer of Code</a> projects I&#8217;ll be refactoringRailties, the internal engine of Ruby on Rails. When a Rails application launches, there is a complicated process of configuration and initialization that sets the Rails web server.</p>

<p>Before you can actually set up this web server, there are quite a few things that need to be configured. Ruby on Rails was developed under the <a href='http://www.google.com'>&#8220;convention before configuration&#8221;</a> mantra. What this means for you is that most of the configuration that needs to be done for a Rails web server has already been set - the defaults should take care of everything.</p>

<p>Railties are the engines for reading these configurations, creating an application, and connecting different parts of Rails.</p>

<h3 id='the_railtie_class'>The Railtie Class</h3>

<p>All major components of Rails are created as a subclass of Rails::Railtie.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the <code>-w</code> switch) to see your changes! To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code>_posts</code> directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='k'>def</span> <span class='nf'>print_hi</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nb'>name</span><span class='p'>)</span>
  <span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;Hi, </span><span class='si'>#{</span><span class='nb'>name</span><span class='si'>}</span><span class='s2'>&quot;</span>
<span class='k'>end</span>
<span class='n'>print_hi</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;Tom&#39;</span><span class='p'>)</span>
<span class='c1'>#=&gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.</span>
